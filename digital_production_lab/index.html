    With her latest album, Alligator Bites Never Heal, self-proclaimed "Swamp Princess" Doechii makes history as the third woman, and second female artist, to win the award for Best Rap Album. The award was presented to her by Cardi B, who was the first solo female artist to win the award in 2019.

        I found it fairly easy to embed this album through Spotify. I went to Spotify and searched for the album, and when you click on share it gives you an embed link that I pasted into VS Code. It fits well with this piece because readers may be interested to hear what the award-winning album sounds like. I think that it could help engage audiences by providing audio context for the award.

    She expressed gratitude in her acceptance speech, bringing her mom up on stage with her, and shouted out hometown talent. "There's so much culture in Tampa, whenever people think about Florida they think about, like, Miami, but Tampa has so much talent. Labels! Go to to Tampa, there's talent there, okay?"

    I found this Knight Lab Sound-Cite tool a little bit more difficult to embed into my story. First, I downloaded the audio of Doechii's acceptance speech from a YouTube video as an MP3 file. Then, I had to figure out how to publish it to the web, which I did using GitHub (I created a new page for it at <a href="https://norarosenfeld.github.io/interactives/soundcite_audio/">this link</a>). Then, I followed the instructions on the Knight Lab Sound-Cite page, pasting in their embed code, and linking my site where I had published the downloaded audio. The tool did allow me to put in a start and stop time on the audio, so I didn't have to trim it down myself before publishing it to the web. I think that it fits well with this piece, because it is nice to hear from the artist as she accepts the award that I am writing about. It engages audiences by giving them a little interactive they can click on and hear a part of the speech.

    The first woman to win the award for Best Rap Album was Lauryn Hill in 1997, with her group Fugees. Here is a timeline of everyone who has won the award since it was introduced in 1996:

    I had a lot of fun creating this Knight Lab interactive timeline, and once I did it was very easy to embed into my project. I downloaded a Google Sheets document from the Knight Lab page where I inputed all of the information and pictures that are included. It also gave an option to input a hexidecimal code to choose a background color for each slide, so I used a color-picker tool to pull a color from each album cover as the background color for that slide. I think that it works well with this project, because it allows viewers to see a history of all of the albums that have won this award in the past. It engages audiences by allowing them to click through each album to see who won each year and how the award has changed over time since it was introduced.
