      The market is located in the Empty Bottle, a bar and show venue in Ukrainian
      Village, from noon to 4pm on the second Saturday of each month from November through April. It features
      around 30 vendors selling things ranging from knitwear, to ceramics, to hand-carved candles,
      to crafts made from locally foraged and repurposed items.

      Visitors are invited to shop with a mimosa in hand as they browse the whimsical wares. Shoppers can develop personal connections
      with artists, ask questions about the art, and witness as artists demonstrate, or even make, the pieces before their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're looking for a unique gift, a fun addition to your home, or just something to do on a Saturday, the Empty Bottle's Handmade Market is a great option!
